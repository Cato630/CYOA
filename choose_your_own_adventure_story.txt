INTRODUCTION: ARRIVAL

As the carriage lurches forward, you're jolted awake from a deep slumber. Your head spins, and your brain feels foggy, as if it's been wrapped in a thick layer of mist. You try to remember where you are and why you're there, but your memories seem to be shrouded in a haze.

You look out the window, and the fog-covered forest slowly passes by, like a ghostly procession. The trees seem to loom over the carriage, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch at the curtains. You shiver, despite the warmth of the carriage, and try to shake off the feeling of unease that's settling in.

Your gaze falls upon a letter sitting in your lap, and you pick it up, hoping it might hold some answers. The parchment is worn and creased, but the seal on the envelope is still intact. You break the seal and unfold the letter, and a faint scent of old parchment wafts up.

The letter is from Eldrin, the elder of Stonehaven, and it's addressed to the guild. As you read the words, your memories begin to return, like fragments of a puzzle falling into place. Eldrin has been researching the Whispering Woods, a place of dark legend and ancient power, and he believes he's made a discovery that could change everything.

But there's something more, something that's been happening in the village. The townspeople have all started having dreams, and what's odd is that the dreams all seem to be the same. They're filled with visions of an unblinking eye, watching and waiting. 
                
Eldrin is convinced that this is more than just a coincidence, and that something is stirring in the woods, something that could threaten the very fabric of reality.

As you finish reading the letter, the carriage slows to a stop, and you hear the sound of the driver calling out to the horses. You look out the window, and see that you've arrived at the edge of the forest. The trees seem to be waiting for you, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch at the curtains.

You take a deep breath, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over you. You know that you're about to embark on a journey into the unknown, a journey that could change everything. But you're ready, or at least, you think you are. You've been trained for this, and you're not going to let a little thing like fear hold you back.

Sucesfully helping Elder Eldrin would put your name in a favorable light with the guild, and you need that in order to move your way up the ranks.

You step out of the carriage, and into the unknown. The forest looms before you, like a dark and foreboding presence. But you're not alone. You have the letter, and the knowledge that you're not just fighting for yourself, but for the people of Stonehaven, and for the future of the world.


INTRODUCTION: THE TRAP

You run affter the carriage and get back in. Your conscience eats at you but you know you wont leave the woods if you continue. The rocking of the carriage lulls you to sleep but your dreams are restless and dark.


CHAPTER 1: INTO THE WOODS

As you follow the path to Eldrins study, you get an uneasy feeling, as if something is watching you from just out of sight. Each step brings a growing sense of urgency and dread, the kind that clings to your skin like cold mist. The trees on either side of the trail lean inward, their trunks gnarled and twisted, forming a canopy that blocks out the fading light.

The path narrows, choked with overgrowth and thorny vines that tug at your cloak like fingers trying to hold you back. The deeper you go, the quieter it becomes — no birdsong, no rustle of animals, just the sound of your own breath and the steady crunch of boots on damp earth. Somewhere ahead, through the thickening fog, you see a dull orange glow.

As you crest a ridge of moss-covered stone, you find yourself overlooking a hollow where the glow becomes clearer. Lanterns—simple, rune-carved orbs of enchanted amber—hover at shoulder height, marking the boundary of a circular clearing. In the center, standing among piles of old tomes, crystals, and ritual implements, is Eldrin.

He does not turn when you approach. Instead, he continues to speak in a hushed chant, one hand raised over a circle etched into the earth, glowing faintly with crimson light. His voice is strained, like he’s holding something back—or holding something in.

Finally, he stops.

“You came,” he says, his voice hoarse. “Good. I wasn’t certain the letter would reach the guild in time… or that anyone would come at all.”

You step forward cautiously, feeling the weight of the place settle on your shoulders. You ask him what’s happening.

Eldrin turns to face you fully now, and you notice the deep bags under his eyes, the way his fingers tremble slightly as he lowers his arm. “They’ve been whispering to me,” he says. “Not just in dreams now. While I’m awake. While I eat. While I breathe. The forest is sick. Something beneath it stirs.”

He gestures to a nearby log, and you sit. The scent of burnt sage and iron fills the air.

“I tried to contain it,” he continues. “To bind it, delay it. But it’s awake now. The Eye. It doesn’t sleep anymore. I need your help to finish what I began. But I fear... I’ve already waited too long.”

He reaches into a satchel and produces a scroll, the parchment covered in complex arcane symbols. You notice small bloodstains on the corners.

“You have a choice,” Eldrin says grimly. “Three paths lie before us. I will not command you — this burden is yours to bear now as much as mine.”

He raises a trembling hand and outlines the options


ENDING A: THE FORGOTTEN ONE

You nod solemnly and step toward the ritual circle, the crimson runes flaring slightly as you cross the boundary. A chill passes through you, like walking through a veil of cold breath. Eldrin begins to chant softly outside the circle, his voice distant and hollow, as if coming from underwater. You kneel and place your hands on the earth, repeating the incantation etched into your mind just moments before.

The moment your voice joins his, the forest responds. Shadows stretch and twitch at the edge of the clearing. A pressure builds behind your eyes, and something alien brushes against your thoughts — probing, curious, hungry. The Eye sees you. It marks you. You try to resist, to hold the boundaries of your self together, but something unravels. With a final whispered word, the circle collapses in on itself, and you fall forward into darkness. The last thing you hear is Eldrin screaming your name.

[Ending: The Forgotten One]


ENDING B: THE WARDEN

You move beside Eldrin and clasp his hand, your other hand drawing a sigil in the air as he directs you. Together, your voices rise in unison, weaving a protective barrier of sound and will. The runes in the circle pulse with synchronized light—gold and violet—and the fog around the clearing thickens like clotting blood. You can feel something ancient pressing against the veil, trying to slip through the cracks.

The chant reaches its crescendo, and for a breathless moment, all is still. Then the Eye opens—not in the sky or the trees, but within. A terrible weight pushes against your soul, but you stand firm, anchoring Eldrin’s faltering voice. With a flash of searing light, the ritual seals. The forest lets out a sound like a groan of relief, and the fog begins to lift. Eldrin collapses beside you, exhausted but smiling. For now, the Eye is bound again, but its gaze lingers on you.

[Ending: The Warden]


ENDING C: ABBANDON THE RITE

You lower Eldrin’s hand, interrupting the incantation. “There’s another way,” you whisper. “We don’t silence it. We listen.” Eldrin’s eyes widen in horror, but he does not stop you. You step into the circle, but instead of invoking the containment rite, you call out—not with words, but with intent. The forest stirs, and the shadows deepen. Somewhere beyond the veil of reality, something not human turns its gaze upon you.

A great silence descends. Not absence of sound, but the devouring of it. The Eye opens, and the air grows thick with revelation. You are shown glimpses: truths beyond sanity, impossible geometry, the ticking pulse of a universe that feeds on thought. It does not lie. It does not promise. It simply offers. And you—too curious, too bold—accept.

The ritual fails, but the forest remains still. Eldrin refuses to speak to you as you leave. The Eye has touched you, but left you intact… for now. With nowhere else to go, you make your way to Stonehaven, the village looming ahead like a question you’re no longer afraid to ask..


CHAPTER 2: INTO THE VILLAGE

You turn your back to the forest path and head toward the dim lights of Stonehaven. The village sits like a worn memory at the edge of the fog, its cobbled streets slick with dew, and its crooked chimneys coughing smoke into the heavy air. As you pass through the gate—unwatched and unguarded—you notice how unnaturally quiet it is. The usual sounds of a waking town are muted, replaced by an eerie stillness broken only by the occasional slam of a shutter or the distant creak of a swinging sign.

The villagers you pass avoid your gaze. Some pretend not to see you; others glance at you with hollow, tired eyes before shuffling away. It’s not just fear — it’s exhaustion. Deep, bone-deep weariness etched into their faces like a sickness. You notice something else too: small charms nailed above doorframes, tiny bundles of sticks and bones shaped into watching eyes. Protection wards, perhaps. Or warnings.

You make your way toward the town square, unsure whether to speak to someone directly or observe from afar. A woman tending a quiet bakery watches you through the window. A boy chases shadows in the alley. The tavern is open, but barely. You feel the letter in your pocket grow heavy, like it knows something you don’t.


ENDING VA: THE SEER

You follow your instinct and head toward the modest bakery tucked along the main street. The smell of stale bread lingers in the air, though the ovens sit cold and unused. Through the dusty window, you see the baker—a woman in her middle years, pale and worn thin by restless nights. She watches you approach but does not flinch away like the others.

When you step inside, a soft bell tinkles overhead, and she gives you a cautious nod. “Traveler,” she says simply, her voice hoarse from disuse. You waste no time. You ask about the dreams—about the eye that watches them all.

Her lips tremble. The loaf she was shaping falls limp in her hands. Slowly, she reaches beneath the counter and pulls out a crude journal, its pages filled with sketches of circles, symbols, and endless, unblinking eyes. “It came to me first,” she whispers. “Then to my children… then to all of us. We dream the same dream, night after night, and each morning we forget… until we see a stranger like you, and it returns.”

You spend the evening reading her notes, piecing together the fragments of broken dreams. Patterns emerge—cycles of waking and forgetting, pulses in the earth beneath the village. The Eye doesn’t just watch—it remembers. You leave the bakery at dawn, mind heavy with knowledge forbidden and fragile, but illuminating in ways few could understand.

[Ending: The Seer]


ENDING VB: THE DRUNKARD

You pull your cloak tighter and make your way toward the crooked wooden sign of The Hollow Hearth. Its hinges groan in the wind, but the door is ajar, a dim orange glow spilling onto the street. Inside, the tavern is half-empty, the air thick with smoke and the stale scent of old ale. A few villagers hunch over their drinks, avoiding each other’s gaze, avoiding yours.

The barkeep eyes you without a word and slides a half-filled mug toward you. No questions, no greetings—just weary silence. You take a seat by the hearth, feeling its warmth seep into your bones. You listen. Conversations here are low, fragmented murmurs—whispers of dreams that linger after waking, of livestock vanishing in the woods, of strange lights pulsing beneath the earth.

You order another drink. Then another. The tension in your shoulders dulls, the gnawing questions fade. The Eye seems distant here, beyond the fog, beyond the woods, beyond the rim of your glass. You tell yourself you’ll leave in the morning—gather your strength, regroup—but morning comes, and you order another round. The world shifts, time blurs, and Stonehaven’s slow descent into madness continues without you lifting a finger.

[Ending: The Drunkard]


ENDING VC: THE DEFENDERS

You move through the village with purpose, knocking on doors, stopping wary townsfolk in the street, and urging them to listen. You speak calmly, carefully—describing the truth without revealing how much you’ve seen, how much you know. Some slam their doors in your face. Others whisper prayers under their breath as they step back. But a few… a few listen.

An old man with a glass eye nods grimly and retrieves a long-forgotten sword from beneath his floorboards. A mother clutches her daughter and says, “The dreams started after the last solstice.” A blacksmith lights a fire in his forge and begins to hammer—not tools, but weapons.

You gather them that night in the village square. Eldrin arrives, surprised but silently grateful, and together you draw protective runes, distribute candles and charms, and prepare for whatever may come. No one speaks of the Eye, but every heart feels its gaze. You know the town may not survive—but they will face it.
