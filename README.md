I am a huge DND nerd and I love playing the game, I have been wanting to create a choose your own adventure game that will eventually evolv into a more single player dnd style campaign. Eventually this game will evolv to creating a basic character and having a memory of hp and stat blocks.
I decided to go more down a Gods of Appilacia with the story in this CYOA because I enjoy a good horror. 

You need to have all three files to run as inteded but you can also run it without the launcher.
I built the launcer on windows 64 but you can still run in it in mac with a slight change


Please enjoy
